sudo rm -rf ~/DEV/go/src/github.com/dotcloud

- Get updated pickett from my branch at https://github.com/igneous-systems/pickett/tree/docker_1.14
# This uses docker/docker repos at version 1.14 , no more (just obsoleted) doctcloud/docker
- Reinstall pickett (godep get, go install etc .....)

- Update docker in vagrant because it's older and incompatible (1.13 VS 1.14)
#  Until I can work with Byron on having the new version in the VirtualBox image
po
ssh vagrant@127.0.0.1 -p 2222
git clone https://git@github.com/dotcloud/docker
cd docker

# retart docker with socket as it's required to build docker
sudo service docker stop 
sudo docker -d &

sudo make build
# Go have some some coffee
sudo docker make binary
# stop the running docker
fg + Ctrl-C
# Copy new docker binary
sudo cp bundles/1.1.2-dev/binary/docker /usr/bin/docker

# Restart docker
sudo docker -d -H "tcp://0.0.0.0:2375" &

exit

-----end vagrant---

export DOCKER_HOST="tcp://127.0.0.1:2375"
